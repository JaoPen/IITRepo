		<h2>INTEREST IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h2>
		
			<ul>
				<li>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline you IT experience. (if any).
					 
					<p>My interest in IT came across when I learned that IT in any specialty is a high-paying profession. Unlike other professions, you only need to study for a short period at university or have certification. My interest began when I was still in high school. I saw my teacher creating programs using COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language). I was fascinated with how the platform was presented, and its functions. This, to me, indicated that taking IT as a course in university would be a good choice. Unfortunately, I was not able to practice what I have learned in the past. I chose to have a family over my career. And now, I am here to refresh my knowledge and gain expertise, with the amazing support of my family. </p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
						
					<p>I chose to come to RMIT because it offers flexible programs that cater to students' needs. It is self-paced, accommodating to students' schedules, who may work in a professional setting. The payment for instruction is not that expensive unlike other universities, which increases its accessibility and convenience. It produces exemplary graduates who land in big companies, teaching individuals the skills to thrive in the industry. RMIT is also very culturally diverse, promoting a safe, kind, and connected environment.</p>
					
				</li>
				
				<li>What do you expect to learn during your studies?
				
					<p>I expect to learn new programs, gain more skills related to my previous studies, and provide great career advancements and opportunities soon. With the use of new skills and programs, I want to be able to take part in IT Support. In a classroom, I want to work well and efficiently with my peers. Through this, I also want to share my existing knowledge to assist others. These are the things I expect to learn during my studies here at RMIT.</p>

		<h5>PROJECT IDEA</h5>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Overview
				
					<p>The project idea is home security using the Raspberry Pi. The prototype will be used in the grounds of private property which will serve as an additional tool to detect unlawful entry (burglary). Because of the high cost of some popular brands like NetGear Arlo and Swann, this prototype will serve its purpose at a fraction of the cost.</p><br>
				
				</li>
				
				
				<li>Motivation
				
					<p>According to statistics, in Queensland, there are 31.5% families who are more concerned about home burglary. And in 2021, 73.5% would like to install a home security to reduce home insurance premium.</p> 

					<p>Living in a quiet suburb north of Brisbane, who would have thought that the installation and cost of home security with the latest technology would be really expensive? Our house is equipped with home security, but it is wireless. We wanted to replace the existing ones and get it wired or as an additional with less cost. The problem is that it will be costly.</p>

					<p>My idea is to build home security using Raspberry Pi; it only costs roughly 5% of the total cost of what we have now. Though this project has already been completed by other experts, I think this is the possible solution for our home security.</p><br>
				
				<p>Statistics reference:</p><a href="https://www.budgetdirect.com.au/home-contents-insurance/research/home-burglary-statistics.html" target="_blank">https://www.budgetdirect.com.au/home-contents-insurance/research/home-burglary-statistics.html</a>
				
						
				</li>
				
				<br><br>

				<li>Description
				
					<p>The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.</p>

<p>This project idea is based on the need of having an additional home security system in order to have peace of mind, thinking that there is unlawful entry occurring and to reduce the premium of home insurance. There are similar projects that are undertaken by experts. I believe that constructing this prototype will be a big help to reduce part of our expenses. Some homeowners invest hundreds of dollars just to protect their property.</p>

<p>This project comes with a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor which will detect if there is movement, and a camera which will capture what the moving is. It will then be sent to a web server. In the web server, there are the list of how many log movements and photos taken since the last history was recorded. It has the capability to send information via email with the last history that occurred, together with an attached photo.</p>

				</li>

				<br>

			
				<li>Tools and Technologies
				
					<p>The tools and technology needed in this proposed project idea are, Raspberry Pi 2 or higher (starter kit), SD card 16GB or higher, electronic component kit (i.e. resistors, wires â€“ male-male etc.), PIR motion sensor, and background in Python programming. </p>
				
				</li>
				
				<br>
								
				<li>Skills required
				
					<p>Skills required are a background in Python Programming, Electrical/Computer Engineering, and Raspberry Pi (preferably). An individual who has better understanding in hardware configuration, know how to source, select and negotiate for the best hardware packages with suppliers. Time management is also essential to complete the project.</p>
				
				</li>

				<br>

				<li>Outcome
				
					<p>If the outcome is successful, I will use the prototype as an additional element added to our home security. It will serve its purpose as an alarm and surveillance system without adding much cost to our expenses. Also, with additional home security, the probability of unlawful entry will decrease and become preventable, and our home insurance premium will reduce.</p>
					
					<p>This prototype will only be installed in our home but can be distributed (limited) to families and friends. It cannot be installed and distributed commercially.</p>
